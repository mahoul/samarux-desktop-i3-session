# samarux-desktop-i3-session

samarux-desktop-i3-session contains the files needed to run an i3 session with support
for the GNOME subsystem services provided via gnome-session.
Most of the files for this are minimal tweaked versions from files
from the awesome Regolith project (https://regolith-linux.org/)
